# classification_image_endoscopique
description :
capsule endoscopy is an alternative to colonoscopy. A capsule endoscope is a camera of the size and
shape of a large pill that is swallowed to visualize the gastrointestinal tract. Capsule video endoscopy
is an appealing alternative to traditional diagnostic techniques, since it allows inspection of the
gastrointestinal tract without discomfort to the patient or need for sedation, thus preventing the risks of
conventional endoscopy. The reliability of the automatic anomaly detection is dependent on making
high quality video recordings of the gastrointestinal tract available for post processing analysis.
In this project we will focus on three aspects; namely the development of a graphical interface that
allows the visualization of images in an intelligent way to facilitate the exploration of anomalies. The
second is the development of a tool to detect images containing anomalies (we will limit ourselves to a
few). And finally, the last one is the video summary.
